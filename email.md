# E-mail

Currently, we don't host our own e-mail services, but we with a [cyon](https://www.cyon.ch) webhosting.

The login for the [cyon admin panel](https://my.cyon.ch/) may be found in pass.

E-Mail accounts should be created in a `first.lastname@qo.is` fashion.

Alias/forwarding Domains may be added on an best effort basis.
Bills for these domains should go directly to the respective owner (i.e. should be registered with own accounts).

## System E-mails

For groups, systems, services that require e-mail access, other accounts may be created.

- Engineering receives mails on `sysadmin@qo.is`
- Servers send from `system@qo.is`
- `no-reply@qo.is` is blackholed and may be used by services that don't handle replies.
- Services include e.g. `vault@qo.is` for vaultwarden.
