# Fabric

The fabric configures the "bare-metal" devices that host the platform and services.

### *env*: **Environment**

Configurations for different environments,
to address differences between production, testing etc.

### *hw*: **Hardware**

- Disk Setup (Raid, encryption etc.)
- Networking hardware

### *machines*: **NixOS Configurations**

## Testing

🚧 Fabric configuration is hard to test - configuration mistakes might be hard to recover from.
